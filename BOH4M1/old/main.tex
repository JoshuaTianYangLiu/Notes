\section{Introduction}
%technology and workforce
\section{Economy}
Let's look at what today's economy look like. Let's describe some characteristics of today's economy.
\begin{enumerate}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
    \item Virtual workplace $\rightarrow$ medical consultations, engineer consultants, educators, non-essential workers.
    \item Recessionary $\rightarrow$ economy shrinking, stock prices, high unemployment rate, she-cession (Recession that primarily impacts women)
    \item Precarious $\rightarrow$ The uncertainty that the gig economy produces (free lancing workers being replaced, or working less hours or more hours, because of technology), no job security, no holiday/no vacation, work on demand, no sickdays, less education required, no workplace benefits, no retirement savings
\end{enumerate}

Companies that work in a gig economy and contribute to the precarious workplace
\begin{enumerate}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
    \item Uber, Lyft
    \item Doordash, SkipTheDishes
    \item Jiffy
    \item Patreon, YouTube, Tiktok
    \item Twitch
\end{enumerate}


Benefits of technology in the workforce

\begin{enumerate}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
    \item Much more efficiency - greater productivity - workers are making better time, automation can make things faster
    \item Lots more data - understand your market much better, you can target your business costs at a higher degree - personal data
    \item Easier communication - speed and access
    \item Consistency and standardization - things are the same then businesses can save money
    \item More mobility - work from home, managers really have to learn about its employees and know if working from home is a good strategy
\end{enumerate}

Downsides of technology in the workforce

\begin{enumerate}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
    \item Automation is a threat for all jobs but specifically jobs that are more repetitive in nature and more basic
    \item People will have to learn new skills and adapt to technology - people will have to work beside technology - certain sectors will experience higher unemployment
    \item Reliance on the technology system - the components to make the technology are often made in other countries
    \item Maintenance is costly
    \item Security and privacy
\end{enumerate}

Governments have a role to play. Governments they want to protect jobs and be seen as creating jobs but they also like to attract technology companies, so there is a contradiction - technology companies can easily remove jobs through automation but governments spend lots of money and other resources to attract these tech companies

What is the impact of Amazon on local retailers

What is the impact of Amazon on suppliers

How can government manage a company like Amazon or is Amazon basically unstoppable

How can we make sure Amazon workers feel recognized and valued

Why would Ontario try so hard to attract Amazon list some reasons

One large impact Amazon will have on retailers would be the competition as Amazon is (the largest?) company have been known to use aggressive tactics to force other businesses out of the market. 

I think the same applies to suppliers, Amazon has its finger in every pie. For suppliers, its Amazon Basics. 

I also think governments would not or would have little influence over Amazon as Amazon is a large company and I think it's easier for Amazon to influence the government with its money through lobbying.

I don't know.

I think Ontario is trying very hard to attract Amazon as bringing Amazon over would bring over businesses as well. 

Does society owe the worker anything

We've really been emphasizing how technology disrupts our working lives - as managers we have to learn how to incorporate technology into our work lives but we have also been learning a bit more in depth about what it means to work today.

The impact of globalization on management strategies

Globalization means the shrinking of things like transactions, economic indicators, the standardization of products and services. However, a more nuanced definition of globalization is that the world is not just connected but is tangled.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Volatility - oil prices in the middle east to the gas prices in Toronto
    \item Supply changes - shock to supply 
    \item Viruses know no borders
    \item Climate change
\end{enumerate}

How can managers handle all this uncertainty brought on by our tangled culture

Managers can handle this by creating a thorough plan

    To prepare for the worst
        always keep a backup plan to your backup plan
    follow global news, see which might affect you


\begin{enumerate}
    \item Localize supply and production -> battery for automobiles (lithuim, ion, nickel, copper)
    \item Conduct research -> forecasting
    \item Know what is going on and get ready for anything that can happen -> don't keep your head in the sand
    \item Be aware and sensitive
    \item Have a plan B -> having supply management
    \item 
\end{enumerate}
